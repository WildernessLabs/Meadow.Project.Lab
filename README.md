# Meadow.ProjectLab

Project Lab is the most functional IoT prototyping platform on the planet. No more breadboards, complicated wiring, or soldering. Project Lab was built from the ground up using the industry's most powerful, capable, and reliable sensors, components, and connectors.

## Purchasing or Building

You can get a Project Lab from the [Wilderness Labs store](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/collections/frontpage/products/project-lab-board).

It's also designed so that it can be assembled at home for the adventurous. All design files can be found in the [Hardware Design folder](Source/Hardware).

## [Getting Started Samples](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.ProjectLab.Samples)

If you've just got a Project Lab, we recommend cloning the [Meadow.ProjectLab.Samples](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.ProjectLab.Samples) repo. There you'll find a bunch of awesome samples that you can run right out-of-the box!

## About the Hardware

The PROJ LAB board includes the following hardware:
* **ST7789** - SPI 240x240 color display
* **BMI270** - I2C motion and acceleration sensor
* **BH1750** - I2C light sensor
* **BME680** - I2C atmospheric sensor
* **Push Button** - 4 momentary buttons

## Connectivity

The PROJ LAB board includes the following expansion connection options:
* **MikroBUS** - 2 sets of MikroBUS pin headers
* **Qwiic** - Stemma QT I2C connector
* **Grove** - analog header
* **Grove** - GPIO/serial header
* **RS-485** - serial 

As well as connectors to 5V, 3.3V, ground, one analog port and 2 GPIO ports.
